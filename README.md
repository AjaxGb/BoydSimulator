# BoydSimulator

A project to generate rambling conspiracy theories using the lines of Boyd Cooper
from the game *Psychonauts*, and attempting to match his output.

Should eventually include audio; I'm figuring out the copyright issues.
Until then just remember that it takes two clicks to generate a new theory,
since it was designed to have audio playing.
