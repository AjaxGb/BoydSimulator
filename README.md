# BoydSimulator

A project to generate rambling conspiracy theories using the lines of Boyd Cooper
from the game *Psychonauts*, and attempting to match his output.

Since I can't just upload files from a copyrighted game, Boyd's voice is not
includedâ€”*by default*. The site provides
[instructions](https://ajaxgb.github.io/BoydSimulator/extracting.html) for extracting
Boyd's audio from your own legal copy of the game, after which you can hear the grand
Milkman Conspiracy in all of its rambling glory.

If you can't or don't want to, the site works just fine in text-only mode.
