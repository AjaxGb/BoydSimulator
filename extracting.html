	Wow, look at that back arrow. I think it's apparent that this will be
	the most gorgeous website ever created in 2017. Anyway:

	<h1>How to Extract the Required Files</h1>
	<ol>
	<li>
		Download <a href="http://quickandeasysoftware.net/software/psychonauts-explorer">
		Psychonauts Explorer</a>. Windows only, I'm afraid.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run the program, click "Open", and navigate to your <i>Psychonauts</i> installation.
		<ul>
		<li>
			The Steam version is found under
			<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Psychonauts</code>.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Find the file containing the voices for the asylum grounds.
		<ul>
		<li>
			In the Steam version, it is called <code>asgrvoice.isb</code>, as in
			<strong>AS</strong>ylum <strong>GR</strong>ounds <strong>VOICE</strong>s.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the Steam version, it is located under <code>WorkResource\Sounds\asgrvoice.isb</code>.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Select "Save All Audio Files" (<strong>not</strong> "Dump All"), and give the
		program a good place to store them. This operation takes about two minutes on my
		computer and produces 120MB of files. 46MB worth of them are unneeded and can
		be immediately deleted, leaving 74MB. You could instead save only the needed
		audio files one by one (Psychonauts Explorer does not allow multiple selection),
		but who has time for that?
	</li>
	<li>
		Now that you have the files, you'll want to isolate Boyd's relevant lines.
		You can delete the other files or keep them, just make sure not to send them
		to the simulator.
		<ul>
		<li>
			They should be numbered from 1 to 202, with two variations each, and have
			similar names otherwise. My copy is missing one variant for 71; this is
			not a major issue. The simulator will just fill in the other one.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the Steam version, they are named <code>ASBR001BOA.wav</code> through
			<code>ASBR202BOB.wav</code>, with an <code>A.wav</code> (outside Boyd's mind)
			and a <code>B.wav</code> (inside Boyd's mind) for each number. <code>AS</code>
			stands for <strong>AS</strong>ylum, <code>BO</code> stands for
			<strong>BO</strong>yd, and I suspect that <code>BR</code> stands for
			<strong>B</strong>oyd's <strong>R</strong>amblings.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		The simulator will assume that the files' names contain a single number
		between 1 and 202, and end with an <code>A</code> or a <code>B</code>, as
		outlined above. If your files do not match this pattern, please edit them
		accordingly. You <em>should</em> have 404 files, but as I said my copy was
		missing a <code>71B</code>, so 403 is acceptable.
	</li>
	<li>
		Go back to the previous page, click the "Select files" button, and select all
		404 (or 403) files, then hit "Open".
	</li>
	</ol>
	<hr>
	Congratulations, the simulator should now play voice files.
